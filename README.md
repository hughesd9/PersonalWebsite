# PersonalWebsite
Creating my first personal website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This personal website has a home page, about me page and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
The home page has information about where and what I studied and information about my Erasmus year and coding languages that I have experience with.
